/// Cache of sandboxfs nodes indexed by their underlying path.

/// This cache is critical to offer good performance during reconfigurations: if the identity of an
/// underlying file changes across reconfigurations, the kernel will think it's a different file
/// (even if it may not be) and will therefore not be able to take advantage of any caches.  You
/// would think that avoiding kernel cache invalidations during the reconfiguration itself (e.g. if
/// file `A` was mapped and is still mapped now, don't invalidate it) would be sufficient to avoid
/// this problem, but it's not: `A` could be mapped, then unmapped, and then remapped again in three
/// different reconfigurations, and we'd still not want to lose track of it.
///
/// Nodes should be inserted in this cache at creation time and removed from it when explicitly
/// deleted by the user (because there is a chance they'll be recreated, and at that point we truly
/// want to reload the data from disk).
///
/// TODO(jmmv): There currently is no cache expiration, which means that memory usage can grow
/// unboundedly.  A preliminary attempt at expiring cache entries on a node's forget handler sounded
/// promising (because then cache expiration would be delegated to the kernel)... but, on Linux, the
/// kernel seems to be calling this very eagerly, rendering our cache useless.  I did not track down
/// what exactly triggered the forget notifications though.
///
/// TODO(jmmv): This cache has proven to be problematic in some cases and should probably be
/// removed.  See https://jmmv.dev/2020/01/osxfuse-hardlinks-dladdr.html for details.
